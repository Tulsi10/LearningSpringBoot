SpringBoot Learning Series

 I have uploaded two files Snippet.java and Hello.java
 
 Snippet.java - Is the main class that will start your Spring Boot Application
 Hello.java - Is the Restcontroller class
 
 And, always remember your all Controller classes should always come after your Main Class(here it is Snippet class).
 Also attaching the screenshot for more understanding.
